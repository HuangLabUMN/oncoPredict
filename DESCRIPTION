Description: Allows for building drug response models using screening data between bulk RNA-Seq and a drug response metric and two additional tools for biomarker discovery that have been developed by the Huang Laboratory at Unniversity of Minnesota. 
    There are 3 main functions within this package - 
    calcPhenotype is used to build drug response models on RNA-Seq data and impute them on any other RNA-Seq dataset given to the model
    GLDS is used to calculate the general level of drug sensitivity, which can improve biomarker discovery
    IDWAS can take the results from calcPhenotype and link the imputed response back to available genomic (mutation and CNV alterations) to identify biomarkers
